I don't want to see you by my side anymore, no, no, no  
I don't want to see you by my side anymore, go away  
I don't want to see you by my side anymore  
No, no, no, oh, no, oh, oh, oh  

You promise and you promise and later you promise me  
And nothing and no-ot-thing  

You promise and you promise and then you promise me  
And you will not fulfill  

Because you are a wolf (Lies)  
A wolf that has always dressed in sheep's clothing (Lies)  
That manages everything for its own convenience (Lies)  
You deceive and look for corners for love  
A wolf  

I was wrong, I know, in always being faithful to you   
I was wrong, I also know, in giving you so much love   

Night after night for your love  
I am a lover without measure  
I am the rhythm and the passion, an erupting volcano  
And then a sleeping lioness  

Your magical moon convinces him to come back today  
If the sun returns, if the day returns, and you return too  
Why wouldn't he come back today?  

I don't ask you for the moon, I just want to love you  
I want to be that madness that vibrates deep inside you  
Na ah ah, na ah ah  
Na ah ah, na ra ni na nah  
Na nor na nor na ah, nah  
Nah  
Ni na, ni na  

Beautiful, transparently beautiful  
Devilishly beautiful, neither the stars nor the moon appear  
Beautiful, mercilessly beautiful  
My beautiful blonde diamond, always continue so  

Yes to fall in love now  
The damn spring will come back to me  
What a dream it is to fall in love  
One hour is enough  
Pass lightly  
Damn spring  
Pass lightly  
Curses only me  

Better times will always come (I swear, I swear it)  
Better times will always come (I swear, I swear it, I swear, I swear it)  
Better times will always come  
Better times will always come
