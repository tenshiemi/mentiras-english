# Hombres al Borde de un Ataque de Celos - Men on the Verge of a Jealous Attack

**Sung by Lupita**

Check it out, teacher  
Hello Boys!  
Take care of me darlings  

High heels  
Mini skirt  
Melting cleavage  
Looks as I go, sunglasses  
Waist wiggles  
Loose hair flutters around  

They call me: hey hey  
They tell me: hey hey  
They follow me like flies follow honey  

I dance at your party  
And when I move my hips they make a circle around me  
They say my legs are as explosive as dynamite in rock  
There is no boyfriend who can resist it, you see, they all end up committing suicide  

Men on the verge of a jealous attack  
Poor men, they are like children, look at them, little babies  
Men on the verge of a jealous attack  
All nerves, what a disappointment (Uy oops)  

Men on the verge of a jealous attack  
Poor men, they are like children, look at them, little babies  
Men on the verge of a jealous attack  
All nerves, what a disappointment
