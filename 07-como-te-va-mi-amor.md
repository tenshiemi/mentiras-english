# Cómo Te Va Mi Amor - How Are You Doing My Love

**Sung by Dulce, *Emmanuel***

**Speaking**  
*Dulce?*  
Emmanuel?  
*Hello!*  
Hello! I, I have to go  
*Me too*  

**Verse 1**  
What surprises life gives  
To find you in the busy street  
It was a spark in my equilibrium  
Dynamite that exploded  

**Verse 2**  
I found you a little thinner  
I was looking at you and breaking down  
I believed you a forgotten affair  
I was mistaken again  

**Chorus**  
How are you doing, my love? How are you doing?  
It was the silent question between you and me  
Are you happy my dear? Without deceiving  
Because love never returned to my door  

**Speaking**  
Well?  
*Dulce?*  
Emmanuel?  
*Yeah*  
How did you find me?  
*Because you left your book lying in the street  
And there was your card  
Teacher: Dulce D'Alessio  
Toy World?*  
It is a kindergarten  
*Oh, hey, shall we get a coffee?*  
No Emmanuel, you are a married man  
*Divorced! I got divorced, I swear*  
Oh, sorry, it's okay, let's go!  
*Let's go!*  

**Verse 3**  
Because time has been an ally  
Maturing this love  
We shouldn't have separated  
It was a mistake now I know  

**Chorus**  
How are you doing, my love? How are you doing?  
It was the silent question between you and me  
Are you happy my dear? Without deceiving  
Because love never returned to my door  
Because love is at my door
