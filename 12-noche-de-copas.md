# Noche de Copas - Drunken Night

I don't ask for your forgiveness because I had reasons  
You were so far away and I was so bad  
And even though I had never cheated on you  
That night my love, I couldn't take it anymore  
But now I know it was a blunder  
I loved you and I love you even though it's already too late  
I wanted to take revenge and the damage is done  
I ask you to forget, love, can you?  

It was a night of drinking, a crazy night  
I kissed other kisses  
I forgot your mouth  
I stained your image, I lost myself alone  
And that's the story  

It was a night of drinks, a crazy night  
I kissed other kisses  
I forgot your mouth  
I stained your image, I lost myself alone  
And that's the story
