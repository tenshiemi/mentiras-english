# Es Ella MÃ¡s Que Yo - It's Her More Than Me

Don't set conditions, enough of hypocrisy  
I am the woman, you are the man, alone in the face of life  
A pair of hearts looking for love  
Do not say no to me  

I want to enter your eyes and see for whom you breathe for  
I want to know everything: truth or fantasy  
Tell me who caresses you better than me  
Who do you dream of, love, who keeps you from me?  
Who steals the heat of your kisses from me?  
Love, even if I suffer, answer me  

Is she more than me? Her  
Tell me, what does she give you that I don't give you? Her  
Is she the one you think of when together with me?  
I need to know if you want her  
Is she more than me? Her, Her 
Tell me the truth
