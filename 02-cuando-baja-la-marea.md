# Cuando Baja La Marea

**Verse 1**  
Air, on this slow summer afternoon  
Your memory is a black and white photo  
That the hours are blurring  
How difficult it is to sketch your features  
Half a day after parting  

**Verse 2**  
Air, ifâ€…your eyes were black figs  
If your teeth were lemon wedges  
I don't remember the arch of your eyebrows  
I can barely even speak  
Of something other than your scent  

**Chorus**
When the tide goes out my mind  
Out of pure self-preservation  
Tries to cauterize every trace  
That leaves behind the footprints of love  

When the tide goes out my mind  
Showing the structure of pain  
Activates a defense mechanism  
So that the heart does not drown  

**Verse 3**  
Air (I can't breathe)  
On this slow summer afternoon (I can't describe it to you)  
Your memory is a black and white photo (Barely outlined)  
That the hours are blurring (No, no)  

**Verse 4**  
Air (I attempt to sketch)  
Your features but already I almost can't (No matter how much I try)  
How difficult it is to recognize (With everything we love)  
That you have barely left a mark (No, no)  

**Outro**  
Air, drowns when the tide goes out  
And the shipwreck is now entire  
What a shame
