# Me Alimento de Ti - I Feed on You

**Verse 1**  
*Look at me, talk to me  
Kiss me, take me with you*  
Listen to me, I will listen to you  
I want to know everything about you  

**Verse 2**  
*With you, I would go to the end of the world*  
Love is a driving force for me  
*I never get tired of kissing your lips*  
Every day I love you a little more  

**Chorus**  
I feed on you, I feed on you  
Because nothing tastes like your love tastes  
Because when you arrive  
I am the full moon that merges with the sun  
I feed on you, I feed on you  

**Verse 3**  
*You in me, I in you  
In every moment of the day*  
To wake up and see you  
It's already enough to be happy  

**Speaking**  
Little bear, what are we going to do today?  
*Of what or what?  
Princess, I'm in a rush, we'll talk when I get back, okay?  
Why don't you go for a walk or go shopping?*  
But it's that, today is, give me a kiss  
Today we celebrate two years of marriage.  

**Verse 4**  
I would go to the end of the world with you  
Love is a driving force for me  
I never get tired of kissing your lips  
Every day I love you a little more
