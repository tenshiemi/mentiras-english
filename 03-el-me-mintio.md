# El me mintió / Mentiras / Mentiras

**Verse 1 **  
He lied to me  
He told me that he loved me  
And it wasn't true  
He lied to me  
He didn't love me  
He never loved me  
He let worship him
He lied to me  
He lied to me  
It was a game and nothing more  
It was just a cruel game for his vanity
He lied to me  

**Verse 2 **  
Of all the love that  
He swore didn't mean anything  
I was just another one  
That loved him  
Lies, everything was a lie  
The kisses, the roses  
The false caresses that shook me  

**Bridge **  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear, I swear it  
I swear  

**Verse 3 **  
Tell me why (I swear, I swear it, I swear)
Do you always only tell me lies? (I swear, I swear it, I swear)
Tell me why (I swear, I swear it, I swear)
Do you never tell the truth? (I swear, I swear it, I swear)
Tell me why (I swear, I swear it, I swear)
You always tell me only

**Verse 4 **  
Lies (lies)  
You made me fall in love  
Based on lies (Lies)  
You fed me  
Always lies (Lies)  
How stupid  
That I always believed you (Tell me why?)  

**Verse 5 **  
Lies (Lies) (He lied to me)  
They burn me like fire (He told me that he loved me)  
Lies (Lies) (And it wasn't true) (You always tell me only)  
That stick into my chest (He lied to me)  
Lies (Lies) (He lied to me) (Lies)  
That kill me, that laugh at me (Tell me why?)  

**Outro **  
Lies
