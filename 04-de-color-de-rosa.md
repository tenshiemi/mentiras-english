# De Color de Rosa - The Color of Pink

**Verso 1**  
It seems that all the songs  
Will be singing of me today  
I'm in love  
It seems that all the poems  
Were written for me  
I'm in love  

**Verso 2**  
It seems that all the people  
Will read on my skin  
I'm in love  
My veins are a torrent  
A volcano in my heart  
My soul is about to explode  
For love, for love  

**Chorus**  
I see beautiful life through rose-colored glasses  
And I am in love with love  
I see beautiful life through rose-colored glasses  
And I am excited about love  
I see beautiful life through rose-colored glasses  
And I am passionate about love  

**Post Chorus**  
My veins are a torrent  
A volcano in my heart  
My soul is about to explode  

**Outro**  
For love, for love, for love
