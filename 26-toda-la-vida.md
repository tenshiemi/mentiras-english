# Toda la Vida (All My Life)

All my life  
Collected a thousand loves  
Juggling  
To not love you exclusively  

All my life  
Discovering hidden doors  
To escape your wounds  
To seek adventures  
May they free me from your kisses  
Just for that, just for that  

All my life to forget you  
To lose you and recover from you  
And not fall asleep in your senses  
Like an idiot in love  
Unmanaged, boring from conforming  

All my life  
Dialing secret numbers  
Sending letters secretly  
Making indiscreet dates  
Like a suicidal romantic  
Yes a suicide, a suicide (na ah)  

All my life  
Always thinking about your selfishness  
And of not being your slave  
I am the slave  
Of my self
