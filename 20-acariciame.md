# Acaríciame / El gato y yo / Acaríciame - Caress Me / The Cat and Me / Caress Me

Caress me  
With crazy hands, drive me crazy  
With nails and smiles, love me  
Love of loving, love of skin  

Caress me  
And drown me in your arms, take care of me  
And kill me slowly, look at me  
Can't you see I'm dying  

Wow!  
Sorry, what happened?  
You bite me...  
Oh, forgive me  
Give me a second, okay? Well?  
It's your wife right? No, don't talk  
I don't need you to talk, just listen to me  

Caress me  
And steal my love like a diamond  
Dominate me like a lover  
Slow, steady  

Caress me  
I'm red hot, tame me  
I am all heartbeat, all skin  
And be happy having me  

Caress me  
As soft as air love  
As strong as the hurricane  
That blinds my mind  

Caress me  
And soak me in your tenderness, love  
Infect me with that madness  
That's in your belly  

Old beggar  

It's from the office, okay?  
Baby, was your flight was delayed or what? It's already late, I'm waiting for you  
They called me and I had to go directly to the office  
Hey baby, I know that since that party things have been a little strange  
Sorry, forgive me for sometimes being like this, but with this pregnancy, my hormones are making crazy. Ay ay ay! Can you hurry up please? It's urgent.  
Are you OK?  
No  
Okay, I'm going there. Princess, forgive me, I have to go to solve a fire incident at the office, we'll talk when I get back, okay?  
Go, hurry up. That way you come back faster, right?  
A lost battle, but not the war. Not the war!  
In love and war all is fair. Oh my God, protect me!  

One of these nights I'm going to kidnap you  
I'm going to seduce you, I'm going to corner you  
Like a kitten I will arrive in one jump on your balcony  
Meow meow  
And with my caresses you will see that I make you purr  
Meow meow  
Whether you want it or not, you will be my wicked cat  

Someone ruins our kitty love  
Because a shoe fell on us from above  
And on the roof the cat and I hover around a balcony  
What a confusion  
And after the scare, the feast begins again  
In the garden  
Despite the shoe, our love has seven lives  

Well?  
Hello how have you been? I miss you  
I'll call you later, okay? I swear.  
Who are you with? No, no, no, listen to me just for a second, please  

Caress me slowly and without fear (Who is it?)  

Caress me and feel me inside your heart  
Love is something more than just a look  
It is not enough to say a few words  
A kiss is nothing more than an emotion  

Who are you speaking to Emmanuel?  
Are you with Daniela?  

Caress me and feel me inside your skin  
Wrap me in your body please  
Forget about time and yesterday  

Caress me as soft as air, my love  
As strong as the hurricane that blinds my mind  

Caress me (Caress me)  
And feel me inside your skin (And soak me with your tenderness, love)  
Wrap me in your body please (Infect me with that madness)  
Forget about time and yesterday (That's in your belly)  

Caress me
