# DÃ©jala - Leave Her

**Sung by Yuri and *Emmanuel***

*Well*  
Where have you been today?  
*Yes, it's me*  
It was our weekly date  
*Oh yeah?*  
Candles, music, champagne  
*Of course, of course*  
Seven days preparing it  
It's always the same situation  
Alone hating you and loving you  

I always end up in a corner  
Alone crying until sunrise  

My love, leave her  
My love, leave her  
What can she have that I don't have?  
What can she give you, tell me?  

My love, leave her  
My love, leave her
