# Te Est√°s Pasando - You're Going Too Far

I didn't know that at this party I would see you so happy  
And that you would be so distant from my world  
Accompanied and arm in arm with each other  

Shut up, get out!  

I didn't know that this moment of meeting us would come  
And that I would die of jealousy for you  
You don't look at me for fear of it giving you away or making you bitter  

Listen to me well, tell the other woman  
To behave herself here  
Don't you dare let her know who is who  
That where there are two it is impossible for there to be three  

Listen to me well, don't come near me  
I'm telling you for your own good  
You're going too far, I'll tell you one time  
Even if I die I swear to be unfaithful to you  

You're going too far  
Be very careful, you are playing with fire.  
Let it be discovered that your love is killing me  
And that my eyes today are reproaching you  

You're going too far  
If she knew how I was kissing you  
I told her that you were loving me  
Don't be impatient because  
Your wife is cheating on you
