# Lo Siento Mi Amor - I'm Sorry My Love

I'm sorry my love but today I'm going to tell you  
Although I may lack courage when speaking to your face  
I'm sorry my love but I'm tired of pretending  
And I intend to end this farce once and for all  

I'm sorry my love  
I'm sorry my love  
I'm sorry my love  

It's been a while since I felt anything when doing it with you  
My body does not tremble with desire when I see you turned on  
And your face and your chest and your hands look like frost  
And your kisses that excited me yesterday don't do anything for me  

And there is another love that I have kept quiet, quiet  
Hidden and vibrant in my soul wanting to scream it out  
And I can't hide it, I can't shut it up, I can't  
And I prefer to say it and shout it than to continue pretending  

I'm sorry my love, I'm sorry  
I'm sorry my love, I'm sorry
