# Tu Muñeca / No Soy Una Muñeca - Your Doll, I Am Not A Doll

They say I'm your doll  
That I no longer do anything but dance to the beat  
When you wind me up  

They say that I fell  
In a similar way  
Giving my life for you  
Anyone  

They say I'm your doll  
Slave of honor  
What does love do for you?  
When you want it  

And that you take me like this  
Going around and around  
Just to show off  
and let them see  

No, well yes, that's why we are the way we are, let's see. Why don't we try to love like men?  
How?  
Lesson number 1: Lie a little  

I love, I say I love you  
I love, and I'm acting, gullible (Aha, aha)  
Kiss, whenever I kiss you  
I lie because I don't feel it, gullible (Aha, aha)  

To love just because without loving is the game I'm going to play  
I can be a volcano of tropical passion, but fictional  

No, we cannot stoop to their level  

Your doll  
That is  
The one you have  
Crawling at your feet  

Your doll  
Yes sir  
Your toy  
When you play at love  

Let's see, let's see, let's share confidences. If you had your affairs with  
Other  
Oh, that's not pride. It was a moment of weakness  
Oh, now! Share confidences. How did you do it?  

I swear, I swear it, I swear, I swear it  
You believe everything I say (I swear, I swear it, I swear, I swear it)  
I say I love you and I pretend, gullible (I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear)  
Aja Aja  

You can possess my body (I swear, I swear it, I swear, I swear it)  
But not my feelings, gullible (I swear, I swear it, I swear, I swear it)  
Aja Aja  

Life is a game of chance and love is a death trap  
I can be a volcano of tropical passion always fictional  

I'm not a doll (Your doll)  
That is used and then left (That's it)  
Lost in any corner (The one you have)  
Don't fool yourself, that's not how I am (Crawling at your feet)  

I'm not a doll (Your doll)  
That you take wherever you want (Yes sir)  
It's me who has the helm (Your toy when)  
Even if you think it's not (You play at love)  
I am the one in charge (The one who never rejects you)  
The one who always desires you (Oh-oh-oh)  
The one who is always safe (Oh-oh-oh)  
The one who is worth her sins (Oh-oh-oh)  

I'm not a doll
