# Medley 1

Don't go. I have to tell you something. Come  
I want to wrap myself in your arms  
Let there not be space between you and me (Na ah ah)  
To be the taste of your mouth  
And to fill me all, all with your aroma (Na ah ah)  
Kiss me and in my lips you will find heat  
Feel me, fragile and papery  
How I tremble for you, na ah ah  

I don't ask you for the moon (You)  
I just want to love you (Magic Moon)  
I want to be that madness that vibrates deep inside (Convince him)  
From me, na ha ha (So that he comes back today)  

My doctor called me on my cell phone. I'm pregnant!  
What? Princess, I'm going to get my coat and we're going home.  
Emmanu–µl I'm pregnant!  
That? Eeh... little bear, I'm going to clean your glasses, they're super dirty  

I don't ask you for the moon ah (You)  
I just want to give myself up (Magic Moon)  
Forever to you, na ah ah (Convince him)  
I don't ask you for the moon ah (So that he comes back)  
I just want to give myself up (Men on the verge of an attack) (Today)  
Forever to you, na ah ah (of jealousy poor men) (If the sun returns)  
Na ah ah, na ra ni na nah (I'm sorry) (You're going too far) (And you come back too)  
Na ni na ni na ah (I'm sorry my love) (Because I wasn't going to)  
Be very careful with fire (return)  
You are playing  
Naaaaaaah (You're going too far) (today)  
Naaah, neither na, nor na (He)  

Oh mama, what happens when there is a blackout?
