# De Mí Enamórate - Fall in Love with Me

**Verse 1**  
To make my dream come true, what will I do?  
Where to start, how will I achieve it  
Your so distant love? The only thing I know  
It's just that I no longer know who I am, where I came and where I'm going.  

**Verse 2**  
Since I saw you I lost my identity  
In my head there is only you and no one else  
And it hurts me to think that you will never be mine  
Fall in love with me  

**Chorus**  
Look  
The day you fall in love with me  
I will be happy and have pure love  
I will protect you and it will be an honor  
Dedicate myself to you, God willing  

**Verse 3**  
Since I saw you my identity I lost  
In my head there is only you and no one else  
And it hurts me to think that you will never be mine  
Fall in love with me  

**Speaking**  
*Sweetie, I can't break up with my girlfriend, we've been together for many years and there's something you don't know  
Today I'm going to ask for her hand  
So maybe it's best if we don't see each other, Emmanuel*  

I have values ​​and I don't want to be the bad guy in the novel  
Maybe this is for the best  
Maybe goodbye  
Goodbye  

Maybe it was too good to be true  
Too good for me  

**Outro**  
Look  
The day you fall in love with me  
I'm finally going to see the light once and for all  
And I will get rid of this loneliness  
Of slavery that day  
You will fall in love with my love  
I will finally see the light once and for all
