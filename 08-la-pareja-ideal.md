# La Pareja Ideal / Celos - The Ideal Couple / Jealousy

**Verse 1**  
*You are the thing my life  
That has given me everything  
You are sensational*  
And you, with your tenderness  
You have taught me to feel  
What is true love  

**Speaking**  
I love you bear?  
*Yes it's for you*  
Oh  
*You don't mind me calling you Bear, do you?*  
No, I love it and you're my baby  
*Baby? I like it*  

**Speaking**  
Where do you walk little bear?  

**Chorus**  
I'm jealous of your eyes when you look at another girl  
I'm jealous, jealous  
I'm jealous of your hands when you hug another girl  
I'm jealous, jealous  
When you walk with someone  
When you meet someone  
When I feel you happy  
I'm jealous, I'm jealous  

**Speaking**  
Baby, are you as happy as me?  
*Oh little bear! More!*  

**Verse 2**  
Before I met you, everything was sad  
I don't know how I could live without you  
*And I didn't imagine  
This that bloomed in me  
And now it makes me so happy*  

**Speaking**  
Baby, I know it's not right for me to ask you this, but will you marry me?  
*Pick a date*  
Really?  
*Really  
Bear, I have to go because I'm very late for a meeting.*  
Okay  
*But I love you*  
I love you more  
*I love you more*  
I love you more  

**Speaking**  
*Hello princess*  
Little bear, how was your flight?  
I was calling you all night at the hotel  
Are you going to be there for Yuri's professional exam?   
There will be a reception at the end  
*Oh, princess, what do you think? I am not going to be able to go  
Because I have to leave Mexico  
I have a convention*  
Oh! Well, don't worry, I'll go alone  
For a change Emmanuel, what's going on?  

**Bridge**  
Today I want to dance only with you  
Today I want to dream that you are mine  

Because the things in life are better lived with you  
Everything is love if we are together  
Today I will give you all my love in a hug (because holding hands, there is nothing like it in the world)  
We will always be the couple (and you will promise that never again)  
Ideal (You will never again make me feel) 

**Chorus**  
Never jealous of your eyes  
When you look at another girl  
I'm jealous, jealous (Because holding hands, there's nothing)  
In the same world (When you walk with someone)  
When you meet with someone  
We will always be  
The ideal couple (I'm jealous, I'm jealous)
