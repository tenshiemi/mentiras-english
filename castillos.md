Verse 1
There was once a country of honey
With vermilion roofs
Where I was queen and he was the king
In a kingdom of love stories
My magical castle in the air
Was shining transparent under the sun

Verse 2
Then came that cruel storm
And the castle of the air fell
A bolt of light opened at my feet
The abyss of your heart
And then I could see it as it was
And what I discovered destroyed me

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Chorus
My king was a stone monster
With a heart of stone
His love was always a lie
Castles that today are ruins
