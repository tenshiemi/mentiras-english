# Pobre Secretaria - Poor Secretary

It's almost 8, I jump into the shower
No, I can't be late
Silk stockings, tight skirt
What makeup should I use?

Seven perfumes, painted nails
Something I can conquer
Some cleavage, something he'll notice
Don't let him work

More daring, less princess
Being elegant, I will like it
More determined, less discreet
More irresistible than yesterday

I throw the house out the window
I must find an elixir
Dear boss, you've done it
I don't know if I can take more

Take notice, take notice in your secretary
Oh lord, what pain
Poor secretary
Ask him to copy
A hundred thousand times I love you

Take notice, take notice in your secretary
Oh lord, what pain
Poor secretary
I think it's lacking
Little to drive me crazy

The door opens and I gape
I feel faint, I don't know why
(Come to the office)
A macho tone, I arm myself with pencil and paper
For a note, for a date, for a compliment
What do I have to do?
Flannel skin, cinnamon eyes
I will die of indifference

That smile, wonderfully, irresistibly seductive
And that attractive executive has broken my heart in two
I fall into your arms, give me a hug
There is no better antidote
Call me slave, call me baby
And please don't ignore me

Take notice, take notice in your secretary
Oh lord, what pain
Poor secretary
Ask him to copy
A hundred thousand times I love you

Take notice, take notice in your secretary
Oh lord, what pain
Poor secretary
I think it's lacking
Little to drive me crazy
