# Mudanzas (Removals)

Today I'm going to change  
To check my suitcases well  
And get my feelings out  
And all resentments  

To clean the closet  
Erase old grudges  
And anguish that was in my mind  
In order to not suffer for such small things  
To no longer be a girl  
To be a woman  

Today I am going to change  
To bring my courage to light  
Surrender to what I believe  
And always be me without fear  
Dancing and singing out of habit  
And see light instead of dark  
Uproot my secrets  
Stop living, if not to live life  
That screams inside me, my freedom  

Today I am going to change, come out from within myself and not just be a heart  
Leave and stop failures, let go of the arms and freedom that oppress my reason  

To fly free with all my defects in order to rescue my rights  
And not charge life with paths and decisions  

Today I want and must change  
Divide time and add to the wind all the things that I dreamed of conquering someday  

Because I am a woman like anyone else  
With doubts and solutions, with defects and virtues  
With love and heartbreak  

Gentle like a seagull but feline like a lioness  
Calm and pacifying but at the same time irreverent and revolutionary  

Happy and unhappy, realistic and dreamer  
Submissive by condition more independent by opinion  
Because I am a woman, with all the inconsistencies that are born from me  
Strong, weak sex  

And to say goodbye to the 80's, the old year welcomes the woman who was born to sing  

Today I'm going to change  
To check my suitcases well  
And get my feelings out  
And all resentments  

She is Manuela  

To clean the closet  
Erase old grudges  
And anguish that was in my mind  
In order to not suffer for such small things  
To no longer be a girl  
To be a woman  

Today I am going to change  
To bring my courage to light  
Surrender to what I believe  
And always be me without fear  
Dancing and singing out of habit  
And see light instead of dark  
Uproot my secrets  
Stop living, if not to live life  
That screams inside me, my freedom
