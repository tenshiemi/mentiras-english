# Ba√±o de Mujeres - Women's Bathroom

**Sung by Emmanuel**

Princess, for God's sake. All this must be gossip and I'm going to explain it to you. I swear.  
Oh! But where could the gossip have come from? I already know.  

I feel ashamed when I hear  
What they have said  
My girls  
At the party  

How is it possible  
Let them invent gossip  
They laugh at me  

I know I'm not a gigolo  
Nor the terror  
of the girls  

But believe me girls  
I am a normal man  
Who can defend himself  

They are burning me and I don't know (Oh eh)  
Who could have started it all  
I need to know (Oh eh)  
Where could the gossip have come from (I already know)  

It came from the women's bathroom  
And my reputation flew away  
If they talk about you  
Tomorrow you die  
It's another dimension, I swear  

It came from the women's bathroom  
And my reputation flew away  
If they talk about you  
Tomorrow you die  
It's another dimension, I swear
