# De Qu√© Te Vale Fingir - What's the Point of Pretending

Dawn came and I continued waiting for him, to see if he would decide for me.  
But he never returned. I lost the battle and the war  
And even if he had won it  
What use would he have been to me?  

What good is it to keep silent in the morning and pretend?  
If so many nights, he doesn't come?  
What's the point of dreaming about that ideal man?  
If his contempt hurts you?  

To fulfill your obligation as a faithful and servile wife  
Leaving aside being happy  
What's the point of your passion, ice on your skin, if he doesn't love you?  
What good is it to you if he doesn't love you?  

If he doesn't look at you when kissing  
If he don't want your body  
If he doesn't feel it vibrate  
If you consume yourself from inside  

If your illusion breaks  
If it doesn't let you out  
If your pain passes  
If he finds you dead in life  

If you run from the truth  
Knowing that she does exist  
If you can save nothing  
If hope is lost  
If he doesn't deserve your love (Skinny, haggard, tired and without illusions)  

Alone
