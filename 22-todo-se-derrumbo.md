# Quiero Dormir Cansado / Todo Se Derrumbó Dentro de Mí - I Want to Sleep Exhausted / Everything Collapsed Within Me

I want to sleep exhausted
So I don't think about you
I want to sleep deeply
And not wake up crying

Everything collapsed
Inside me, inside me
Until my breath now
It tastes like bile to me, it tastes like bile to me

My dears, if you are gathered here it is because someone finally achieved his goal: to kill me.
