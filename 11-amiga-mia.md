# Amiga MÃ­a / Ese Hombre No Se Toca

**Sung by Daniela, *Yuri***

So it's true, I can't believe it  
Since when? Since always, right?  
That day when I told you at my quince, you said that you didn't have any secret, but you did have one and that was that you wanted to be with Emmanuel, right?  
Was that true?  
You're full of shit  

*Hear me, please, don't say anything, forgive me*  
Although you say what you say  
Although if you cry it's the same  
Despite being friends, I don't believe you  

*I know you will believe  
That it is just a game between us two  
I swear this time I fell in love  
As I've never fallen in love*  

Coquette, always after him, always after him, night and day  
Cat in heat after him, always after him, just like a shadow  
You dream of him, you dream of him, I can tell  
Your impudence is total, what does it matter to you that I love him?  

*My friend, I know that I am taking away the man of your life* (You dream of him, you dream of him)  
*My friend, I know that I am killing you and your agony is slow* (I can tell)  
*My friend, how difficult it is to call you a friend now* (Your impudence is total, what does it matter to you)  
*My friend, I love him so much and I know that he adores me too* (What does it matter to you, what does it matter to you that I love him)  

This man does not touch himself (*My friend*)  
Enough of this nonsense (*My friend*)  
Find out once and for all (*My friend*)  
This man does not touch himself (*My friend*)  
I swear to you my friend (*My friend*)  
I will defend his love like a crazy woman (*My friend*)  

**Both**  
My friend, my friend, my friend
