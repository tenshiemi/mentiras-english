# Solamente Amigas - Only Friends

If my world collapses  
And without remedy I start to cry  
You always arrive on time  
You hold my hand, you listen to me talk  

If I want to keep my secrets  
You never ask  
I feel a strength that comes from you  
And I smile again  

Dani, forgive me for, for having betrayed you with Emmanuel  
I already understood that our friendship is greater and I am clear that you never have, I tell you from the bottom of my heart  
Forgive me  

You and I are not  
Only friends  
We traveled the world  
More than once  

And because we went  
Like two sisters  
We have shared  
Laughter and loneliness  

And nothing will be impossible  
A solution always exists  
Say that despite the distance  
You will remember me  

You and I are not just friends  
We traveled the world more than once  
Because we are now something more than friends  
We have shared laughter and loneliness  

And no one will be able to crush us  
There is always a solution to a disaster  
Do you know how to count? Well, count on me  
What a great phrase!
